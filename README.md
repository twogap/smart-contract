Audit by Blockchain Consilium

This code is very clean, thoughtfully written and in general well architected. The code conforms closely to the documentation and specification – we loved reading it.
The code is based on OpenZeppelin in many cases. In general, OpenZeppelin’s codebase is good, and this is a relatively safe start.
Overall the code is well commented and clear on what it’s supposed to do for each function. The visibility and state mutability of all the functions are clearly specified, there are no confusions. This is a secure contract that will work as expected after reading the code.
